Revision history for Kafka package

0.800_16 Fri Nov  08 2013
    BUGFIXES:
    - Fixed problem with connecting to servers running on localhost.

0.800_15 Wed Nov  06 2013
    CHANGES:
    - Improvement of test t/*_io.t .

0.800_14 Thu Oct  31 2013
    CHANGES:
    - We use alarm internally in Kafka::IO (not Time::HiRes::alarm).
    - For 'gethostbyname' operations the timeout is rounded
      to the nearest greater positive integer.

0.800_8 - 0.800_13 Wed Oct  30 2013
    CHANGES:
    - Debugging Test t/*_io.t .

0.800_7 Mon Oct  28 2013
    CHANGES:
    - t/*_io.t test more ways how external alarm may interfere with internal
      alarm used by Kafka::IO.
    - Added to META.yml the list of the modules provided by this distribution.

0.800_6 Fri Oct  25 2013
    CHANGES:
    - You can disable ALARMS usage by Kafka by passing timeout => undef to
      Kafka::Connection->new or Kafka::IO->new. In this case '$REQUEST_TIMEOUT'
      is used for the rest of IO operations.
    BUGFIXES:
    - Kafka::IO->new preserves external alarms but this may delay alarm signal
      delivery (thanks to Stephen Sprague).

0.800_5 Fri Oct  18 2013
    CHANGES:
    - Test t/??_io.t checks the external ALRM signal handler.

    - Refactored error handling. See documentation for module Kafka::Exceptions.
